# Discord-Mass-DM-Delete
Do you want to delete all your discord DM's with a specific user all at once? Most likely not but I did, so I made this tool.

 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 1. Open Discord in your web browser
 * 2. Navigate to the DMs of the user that you want to delete your messages with
 * 3. Open browser developer console (Ctrl+Shift+I then go to "Console")
 * 4. Paste this script and press Enter
 * 5. Follow the prompts to confirm deletion
 * 
 * NOTE: This script only works for your own messages (you cannot delete the other persons messages)
 * NOTE: This script isn't some shady tool to pull discord tokens... Review the code before using. This was made for personal use!
 * NOTE: And remember use responsibly and at your own risk.
